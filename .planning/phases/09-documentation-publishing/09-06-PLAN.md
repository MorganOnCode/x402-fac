<objective>
Final verification and project closure. Close Phase 9 security checklist items in ROADMAP.md, update ROADMAP.md with all plan references, mark Phase 9 complete, and update STATE.md.

Purpose: Clean project closure -- all documentation deliverables verified, roadmap updated, project state reflects completion.
Output: Updated ROADMAP.md and STATE.md marking Phase 9 (and the entire 9-phase roadmap) as complete.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Close security checklist and update ROADMAP.md</name>
  <files>.planning/ROADMAP.md</files>
  <action>
Read `.planning/ROADMAP.md` and update the Phase 9 section:

1. **Close security checklist items** in Phase 9. For each unchecked item, add evidence:
   - `[ ] /supported doesn't expose sensitive configuration` -> `[x]` with evidence: "Returns only kinds/extensions/signers (scheme, network, addresses). No config, keys, or internal state exposed."
   - `[ ] Documentation doesn't include real API keys or secrets` -> `[x]` with evidence: "All docs use placeholders (YOUR_USERNAME, your-blockfrost-project-id). Grep confirms no real keys."
   - `[ ] Final security scan (OWASP ZAP) on all endpoints` -> `[x]` or accepted risk with evidence: "Accepted risk: OWASP ZAP deferred to post-launch. Adversarial test suite (06-03) provides interim coverage. Rate limiting, body limits, input validation all verified."
   - `[ ] SECURITY.md with responsible disclosure process` -> `[x]` with evidence: "SECURITY.md created with vulnerability reporting process, response timeline, scope, and known security properties."
   - `[ ] License reviewed for liability implications` -> `[x]` with evidence: "Apache-2.0 selected. Matches upstream x402 protocol. Includes patent grant and standard liability disclaimer."

2. **Update Plans section** from `TBD` to actual plans:
   ```
   **Plans**: 6 plans in 3 waves

   Plans:
   - [x] 09-01-PLAN.md -- OpenAPI/Swagger integration (wave 1)
   - [x] 09-02-PLAN.md -- README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md (wave 1)
   - [x] 09-03-PLAN.md -- Architecture diagrams (Mermaid) (wave 1)
   - [x] 09-04-PLAN.md -- npm publishing setup (tsup dual entry, exports map) (wave 2)
   - [x] 09-05-PLAN.md -- Deployment guide and positioning document (wave 1)
   - [x] 09-06-PLAN.md -- Final verification and ROADMAP update (wave 3)
   ```

3. **Mark Phase 9 complete** in the phase list:
   Change `- [ ] **Phase 9: Documentation & Publishing**` to `- [x] **Phase 9: Documentation & Publishing**`

4. **Update Progress table**:
   Change Phase 9 row to: `| 9. Documentation & Publishing | 6/6 | Complete | 2026-02-12 |`

5. **Remove the placeholder plan**: Replace `- [ ] 09-01: TBD` with the actual plan list.
  </action>
  <verify>`grep -c '\[x\]' .planning/ROADMAP.md` shows all Phase 9 security items checked. `grep 'Phase 9' .planning/ROADMAP.md` shows complete status.</verify>
  <done>ROADMAP.md shows Phase 9 complete with all security items closed and all 6 plans listed.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update STATE.md with project completion</name>
  <files>.planning/STATE.md</files>
  <action>
Read `.planning/STATE.md` and update:

1. **Current Position** section:
   ```
   Phase: 9 of 9 (Documentation & Publishing) -- COMPLETE
   Plan: 6 of 6 in phase 9 (wave 3) -- DONE
   Status: Phase 9 complete -- All 6 plans executed, documentation and publishing ready
   Last activity: 2026-02-12 - Plan 09-06 executed (Final verification + ROADMAP update)

   Progress: [████████████████████████████████] Phase 9 complete
   Phase 9: [██████████] 6/6 plans complete
   Next: PROJECT COMPLETE -- All 9 phases delivered
   ```

2. **Performance Metrics** -- Add Phase 9 row to the By Phase table:
   ```
   | 09-documentation-publishing | 6 | TBD | TBD |
   ```
   (Actual times will be filled in by executor; use placeholders if exact times unknown)

3. **Session Continuity** section:
   ```
   Last session: 2026-02-12
   Stopped at: Completed 09-06-PLAN.md (Final verification + Project complete)
   Resume file: PROJECT COMPLETE -- all 9 phases delivered
   ```

4. **Add Phase 9 Completion Summary** at the bottom (same pattern as Phases 1-8):
   ```
   ## Phase 9 Completion Summary

   Phase 9 documented the system for public sharing and prepared for open-source publication:

   - **09-01**: OpenAPI/Swagger integration -- @fastify/swagger + fastify-type-provider-zod, schema declarations on all 7 routes, Swagger UI at /docs
   - **09-02**: README, LICENSE (Apache-2.0), CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md
   - **09-03**: Architecture diagrams -- 4 Mermaid diagrams (component, payment flow, internal, data flow)
   - **09-04**: npm publishing setup -- dual tsup entry points (server + SDK), exports map, files whitelist
   - **09-05**: Deployment guide and Cardano x402 positioning document
   - **09-06**: Final verification, security checklist closure, ROADMAP update

   Key artifacts:
   - `README.md` -- Quick start, API reference, SDK usage
   - `LICENSE` -- Apache-2.0 (matches upstream x402 protocol)
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md` -- Dev setup, coding standards, PR process
   - `SECURITY.md` -- Responsible disclosure process
   - `docs/architecture.md` -- 4 Mermaid diagrams
   - `docs/deployment.md` -- Docker + bare metal deployment guide
   - `docs/cardano-x402.md` -- Why Cardano for x402
   - `/docs` endpoint -- Interactive Swagger UI
   - `package.json` -- exports map with ./sdk subpath, files whitelist
   - 383+ tests across 27 suites, all passing
   ```

5. Update the **Pending Todos** section -- review if any Phase 9 todos were addressed.
  </action>
  <verify>`grep 'Phase 9' .planning/STATE.md` shows completion. `grep 'PROJECT COMPLETE' .planning/STATE.md` returns a match.</verify>
  <done>STATE.md reflects Phase 9 and overall project completion. All 9 phases delivered.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. ROADMAP.md Phase 9 security items all `[x]`
2. ROADMAP.md Phase 9 plan list complete with `[x]` markers
3. ROADMAP.md progress table shows Phase 9 complete
4. STATE.md shows Phase 9 complete, project done
5. All prior plan SUMMARYs exist (01-05)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Every Phase 9 deliverable is accounted for in ROADMAP.md
- All security checklist items closed or accepted risk documented
- STATE.md reflects project completion
- The 9-phase roadmap is fully delivered
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/09-documentation-publishing/09-06-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
